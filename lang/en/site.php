                                While interacting with our website, the company may use a browsing feature called "cookies" to collect information without identifying the owner and to track your browsing patterns on our site. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identifier number that identifies your browser to the company\'s computers each time you visit one of our websites using those cookies. These files tell the company which pages of the site have been visited and how many users visited each page, thus improving the browsing experience for visitors to the website. Cookies also recognize your computer to save your preferences and display ads when you return to the site, based on how you browsed the site previously. The company collaborates with third parties that use these cookies to help us manage traffic, research, and analytics.
                            <br>
                                The use of cookies is considered standard in this industry, and many major browsing tools are set up to accept these files. However, you can change your browser settings to either refuse all cookies or notify you when you receive one of these files. But if you refuse them, some features on the company\'s website may not function properly.

                            3.3 How does the company obtain your consent?
                            <br>
                                Sometimes, the company may request your consent before processing your personal data. In such cases, the form of consent may vary depending on the circumstances and the type of personal data required. To determine that consent, the company considers the sensitivity of the information and your reasonable expectations, enabling you to understand the nature of the collection of your personal data, its purpose, and its implications. The company ensures to obtain your explicit consent whenever the personal data is likely to be sensitive, such as information related to race, ethnic origin, political views, religion, trade union membership, biometric/biological traits, health, sexual life, or sexual orientation.

                            <br>
                                Consent may be obtained through one of the following methods:

                            </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The company may request you to fill out a form to obtain consent and collect personal data, while informing the customer of the intended purpose for using that data. Completing and signing the form will be considered as the customer\'s acceptance of the collection of information and the intended uses.</li>
                            <li>Personal data may also be obtained verbally when collecting information over the phone.</li>
                            <li>When the customer uses any of the products or services.</li>
                            <li>You can withdraw your consent to the use of your data at any time. In this case, any actions taken by us with your personal information based on your consent up to that point will not be considered legally invalid. This includes your right to withdraw consent for the use of your personal data for marketing purposes. If you wish to withdraw your consent for the collection, storage, use, or disclosure of certain personal information, please contact the company via its email.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            3.4 What happens if you do not provide us with the information we request, or if you ask us to stop processing your data?
                            <br>
                            If you do not provide the required personal data, or if you refuse or withdraw your consent for us to process your data when we need it to provide you with the product and/or service, we may not be able to provide you with the requested product and/or service. We will clarify the consequences for you at that time to help you make your decision.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3.5 With whom do we share your personal data?
                            <br>
                                We share your personal data with trusted third parties that we rely on to provide the products and/or services you or our customer have requested. These third parties are committed to similar and strict obligations to maintain privacy and confidentiality.
                            <br>
                                We share your personal data with third parties who perform tasks on our behalf, and at the same time provide us with specific products or services, such as professional consultants and IT consultants who are required to test and develop our business technology systems, research centers, email lists, and online activity coordinators. These third parties are also bound by strict commitments to maintain privacy and confidentiality.
                            <br>
                                We share your personal data with other companies mentioned on this website for operational and commercial purposes primarily. As we continue to grow our business, we may buy or sell other businesses. If any entity intends to acquire or merge with our company, your personal data will be disclosed to that entity. On the other hand, in the event of bankruptcy or restructuring, any such information will be considered our property and may therefore be sold or transferred to third parties.
                            <br>
                                We also share your personal data with other external parties when necessary to comply with a legal obligation when we believe in good faith that there is a legal basis, or in response to requests from government bodies conducting investigations, or to verify or enforce our policies, prevent or address fraudulent activities, technical or security vulnerabilities, respond to an emergency, or protect the rights, property, safety, or security of third parties, visitors to our website, our business, or the public in general.
                            <br>
                                We do not sell your personal data. However, when your personal data is disclosed to any third party that is not a partner or affiliate of the company, or to an external service provider, we are committed to obtaining the individual’s consent, unless required or permitted by law. Only the minimum necessary information will be provided to that third party under the prevailing circumstances, and the use of personal data for purposes other than the intended purpose is prohibited.
                            </p>
                        <p>
                            3.6 Is your personal data transferred outside the country?
                            <br>
                                If the external service provider is located in a foreign country, it is likely that your personal data will be processed and stored in that country. Under these circumstances, governments, courts, law enforcement authorities, or regulatory bodies in that foreign country may have access to your data in accordance with the applicable laws in that country. However, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are applied when transferring your personal data to a foreign country.
                        </p>

                            <br>
                            The nature of the protective measures varies depending on the sensitivity, scope, and method of storage of personal data. The most sensitive types of personal information are surrounded by higher levels of protection, such as encryption. If you would like more information about the protective measures we apply, please contact us via email at contact@ikhwanetwork.com.

                            <br>
                            Personal data will be automatically deleted if it is no longer required, and there is no legal justification for retaining it.

                                The right to erase information: Also known as the \'right to be forgotten,\' in other words, you may request the deletion or removal of your information when there is no compelling reason for us to continue using it. This right is not absolute, and there are exceptions.
                            </li>
